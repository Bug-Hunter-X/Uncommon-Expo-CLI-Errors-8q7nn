This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error is characterized by cryptic messages and often stems from subtle issues in project configuration, dependencies, or interactions with native modules. 

The `expoBug.js` file contains a simplified representation of a project exhibiting the problem. The `expoBugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version and explanation.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Try to run `expo start` (or any relevant Expo CLI command).
4. Observe the error. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking configuration files (like `app.json`, `package.json`, and potentially native Android/iOS files) for inconsistencies or incorrect settings. Refer to `expoBugSolution.js` for a sample fix.  The root cause might vary, but often involves resolving dependency conflicts, correcting pathing, ensuring proper module installations, or fixing native module setup.
