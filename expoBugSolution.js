The exact solution depends on the specific error encountered. However, common strategies include:

1. **Check `package.json` and `app.json`:** Verify dependencies are correctly listed, versions are compatible, and the app configuration is accurate.  Look for missing or outdated packages.
2. **Clean and rebuild:** Try `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start` to clean the build cache. 
3. **Check native code:** If you've implemented native modules (Android or iOS), check them for errors and ensure that they are correctly integrated with the Expo project. 
4. **Review Expo documentation:** Check Expo's official documentation for any warnings or known issues concerning the libraries or functionalities you are using.
5. **Examine logs carefully:** Expo CLI usually provides log files with more details about the encountered error. These logs are often more informative than the short, cryptic error message displayed on the terminal.  Review the logs to identify specific error codes or messages that could point to the underlying cause.
6. **Simplify the project:** Temporarily remove unnecessary components or dependencies from your project to isolate the source of the problem.  Gradual reintroduction of removed parts may pinpoint the problematic component or configuration element.
